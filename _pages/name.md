I've heard many different pronunciations of my name and by now I've come to terms with them. The approximation "No-Amy Glay-zer" (with a soft Z) is the closest to the true pronunciation using English phonemes and probably almost indistinguishable from the real thing for English speakers. If you are interested, however, here is the correct way to say it.

My first name is Italian and my last name is German. While there can be some variation based on regional dialects, and others with these names may have different preferences, here is how I pronounce my name (using the notation of International Phonetic Alphabet):

Noemi: [noˈeːmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Italian)  
Glaeser (Gläser): [ˈɡlɛːzɐ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German)
