My first name is Italian and my last name is German. The approximation "No-Amy Glay-zer" (with a soft Z) is the closest to the true pronunciation using English phonemes and probably almost indistinguishable from the real thing for English speakers. However, the "correct" pronounciation of my name is as follows (using the notation of International Phonetic Alphabet):

Noemi: [noˈeːmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Italian)  
Glaeser (Gläser): [ˈɡlɛːzɐ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German)
