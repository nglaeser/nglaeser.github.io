### Crypto Glossary

When I started grad school, I began collecting what I learned about cryptography in a sort of [glossary](https://nglaeser.github.io/crypto-glossary). Its purpose was mainly personal, since rewriting definitions and connections between cryptography concepts in my own words helps me to better understand them. However, I've tried to make it generally accessible so it may be a helpful resource for others as well. If I wrote something stupid or if you simply have something to add, please feel free to open a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nglaeser/crypto-glossary/pulls">pull request</a>.

<!-- ### Typos

Found a typo in one of my papers? I've uploaded the source of most of my papers on GitHub, so please open a pull request to correct it by clicking the "typo?" link next to the paper [here](/publications). Thanks! -->

<!-- ### LaTeX Paper Template -->

<!-- ### CryptoPrelims 

Hoping to do for Prelims sections what [CryptoBib](https://cryptobib.di.ens.fr/) did for Reference sections. A set of standard primitives & notation from which you can easily pull the relevant pieces into your Prelims. -->

### Reading List

Here are some articles/blog posts I particularly enjoyed/found useful. I hope they may give you some new insights as well:
- [Paper Pitfalls: Lessons From Reviewing](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~kaptchuk/blog/post/reviewing-reflections.html) by Gabe Kaptchuk

### Notion Template

I use <a target="_blank" href="https://notion.so">Notion</a> to manage a lot of my work, and since I've been asked about my workflow a few times before, I decided to create a template of my setup and share it here: [demo template](https://nglaeser.notion.site/Kanban-Notion-template-demo-fb5828df683d49f18ad7cc29535b360c?pvs=4) ([clean version](https://nglaeser.notion.site/Kanban-Notion-template-clean-209e21b3c3044a46ae3be04ca8fc06e2?pvs=4)).

_Note: I'm in the process of moving over to Obsidian, and hopefully I'll eventually finish and update this page. (If you have any tips on Obsidian workflows, please share! :slightly_smiling_face:)_
