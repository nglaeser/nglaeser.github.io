:loudspeaker: **_I am currently looking for applied research positions in industry. Please see [my résumé](../files/Glaeser_resume.pdf) and reach out if you think I may be a good fit!_**

Hello! I am an [applied cryptographer](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~kaptchuk/blog/post/work-with-me.html#appliedcrypto) working on the design and analysis of cryptographic protocols, especially in the context of blockchains. My work aims to bridge theory and practice with the goal of helping to empower users, increase privacy, and reduce or eliminate trusted third parties. 

I completed my PhD in Computer Science in December 2024, advised by [Jonathan Katz](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/) at the [University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/nglaeser) (UMD) and [Giulio Malavolta](https://sites.google.com/view/giuliomalavolta/) at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/person/116161/14251) (MPI-SP) via the [Maryland-Max Planck Program](https://www.cs.umd.edu/maryland-max-planck). My dissertation was entitled **["Practical Cryptography for Blockchains: Secure Protocols with Minimal Trust"](../files/diss.pdf)**.
In summer 2023, I was a research intern at [a16z crypto](https://a16zcrypto.com/research/), and in summer 2022, I was at [NTT Research](https://ntt-research.com/cis/). 
I was also a recipient of the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
